In line with this commitment, **Enegel.ai does not use any customer audio, video, chat, interaction transcripts, attachments, or other customer data to train Enegelâ€™s or third-party artificial intelligence models.** This ensures that any personal or sensitive information shared by customers during interactions remains confidential and is not used for any ulterior purposes.

## The Customer is in Control

Beyond our responsible AI policy of customer data, Enegel.ai further empowers its users by placing them at the helm of their data. Customers have full control over what data is to be processed by Enegel.ai, configuring what data is stored and for how long. 

At Enegel.ai, we don't just prioritize enhanced customer experience; we ensure it's anchored in trust and transparency.

## AI Regulation is developing topic

The definition of Responsible AI has been evolving and we are committed to continue our monitoring of the latest and greatest thinking in this area. Check out the latest White House AI Bill of Rights, and the President Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.
