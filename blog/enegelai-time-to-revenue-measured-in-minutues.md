Yesterday's landmark announcement from OpenAI has resoundingly confirmed that Generative AI is set to become better, faster, cheaper, and the pace of change is going to be fast. Businesses that haven't yet implemented a Generative AI strategy may find themselves at a disadvantage as competitors are likely to have embraced this innovation.

Enegel.ai remains committed to the Generative AI revolution, daring and swift advancements. A crucial measure of such rapid innovation is the Time-to-Revenue.

The metric of Time-to-Revenue is a critical gauge for businesses, indicating the duration from contract execution to the generation of revenue. The essence of profitability is predicated on minimizing this interval—after all, until revenue streams begin, a company must shoulder ongoing expenses, from platform maintenance to employee salaries for deployment tasks.

For cloud service providers, curtailing time-to-revenue is a perennial challenge. A reduced Time-to-Revenue signals a healthier business ecosystem, as it slashes the period where expenses outpace income from customer payments. Nonetheless, streamlining system configuration and preparation for production is seldom straightforward.

It's with great pride that I share Enegel.ai's achievement in this domain—we've managed to compress our Time-to-Revenue to mere hours, sometimes even minutes. Our ability to transition from contract execution to full production mode so swiftly is a testament to our innovative approach.

Several pivotal factors underpin this efficiency:

**Revolutionary Learning with Generative AI**: Unlike traditional deep learning, which necessitates amassing vast datasets, our generative AI at Enegel.ai requires only a set of basic facts to learn. This paradigm shift eliminates the need to collect and train on extensive customer data, expediting the journey to production readiness.


**100% Usage-Based Model**: Our commitment-free, usage-based pricing structure empowers customers to start modestly and scale at their own pace, thereby facilitating easier buy-in and contract commitment. This flexibility enables a smooth transition to production with an initial set of use cases, which can be broadened over time.


**Leveraging Cutting-Edge Cloud Technologies**: We harness the most advanced cloud solutions available, ensuring instant deployment and effortless scalability for our clients.


Enegel.ai is committed to maintaining this momentum, continuously seeking ways to refine our processes to benefit our customers.

We offer a complimentary “
