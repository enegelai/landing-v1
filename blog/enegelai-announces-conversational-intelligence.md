## Customer Satisfaction

Despite massive investments in Customer Experience (CX), customer satisfaction has continued a steady decline.  For example, the US Banking sector has seen a decline in NPS for the past 10 years!  The inconvenient truth is that despite increasing returns for the business, the CX industry has been losing ground to consumer expectations.  


Why? Consider a sampling of widely recognized CX improvements over the past two decades:
- Improving access to banking with ATMs, web banking, mobile
- Automating ecommerce sales and product returns
- Reserving cars and dining services with finely tuned mobile applications

Do you notice a theme?  All of these “improvements” remove people from the customer experience.  We benefit from increased access and transactional speed but we’re left feeling increasingly detached and unheard, especially when something goes wrong.  

## Massively Improving CX with Generative AI

How would CX evolve differently if there was technology that could “understand” like a person and communicate like a person?  Welcome to 2023!


We’ve witnessed the introduction of a new generation of AI technology that in many ways has more cognitive ability than a person and can effectively communicate in the language of people: Generative AI.  We believe Generative AI will trigger a renaissance in CX by massively improving the productivity and elevating the human experience for both consumers and CX professionals.


## Enegel.ai Conversational Intelligence

I’m pleased to introduce our first product: Conversational Intelligence.  With this product we are taking on one of the more expensive and monotonous back-office tasks in a contact center operation: quality and performance management.  We’ve developed a software product that can analyze customer service conversations and produce personalized performance reports that are superior to those produced by quality management staff.


Our out-of-the-box Conversational Intelligence reports score conversations on ten common customer experience KPIs with ‘human-like’ evaluation of the agent's performance:
- **Flow and Logic**
- **Personalization and Context**
- **Language and Tone**
- **Two Way Conversation**
- **Accuracy of Responses**

 
We also generate metrics for Customer Satisfaction and NPS; eliminating the need for cumbersome surveys and expensive voice of customer software.


Our Conversational Intelligence reports highlight problems for management and also provide personalized feedback for the agents including a list of strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.  The insights include sophisticated conversational analysis such as identifying an agent who is polite but shows a lack of empathy for a customer service issue.  Our software also provides personalized coaching feedback such calling attention to how an agent could develop better listening or objection handling skills.


Conversational Intelligence is a fully automated solution that can be deployed to analyze a sampling of customer service conversations as is common in most contact centers today or it can be deployed more comprehensively to increase coverage, improving performance of the team.


[Enegel.ai](https://www.enegel.ai) Conversational Intelligence brings consistency and excellence to every analyzed conversation.  It is the first step in our journey to improve the CX with Generative AI.  We’re so confident in our Conversation Intelligence solution that we invite you to try it for free and compare it to the reports produced by your quality management team.
