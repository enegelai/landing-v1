For example, the US Banking sector has seen a decline in NPS for the past 10 years! The inconvenient truth is that despite increasing returns for the business, the CX industry has been losing ground to consumer expectations.</p><p>Why? Consider a sampling of widely recognized CX improvements over the past two decades:</p><ul><li>Improving access to banking with ATMs, web banking, mobile</li><li>Automating ecommerce sales and product returns</li><li>Reserving cars and dining services with finely tuned mobile applications</li></ul><p>Do you notice a theme? All of these “improvements” remove people from the customer experience. We benefit from increased access and transactional speed but we’re left feeling increasingly detached and unheard, especially when something goes wrong.</p><h2 id="massively-improving-cx-with-generative-ai" tabindex="-1">Massively Improving CX with Generative AI <a class="header-anchor" href="#massively-improving-cx-with-generative-ai" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Massively Improving CX with Generative AI&quot;">​</a></h2><p>How would CX evolve differently if there was technology that could “understand” like a person and communicate like a person? Welcome to 2023!</p><p>We’ve witnessed the introduction of a new generation of AI technology that in many ways has more cognitive ability than a person and can effectively communicate in the language of people: Generative AI. We believe Generative AI will trigger a renaissance in CX by massively improving the productivity and elevating the human experience for both consumers and CX professionals.</p><h2 id="enegel-ai-conversational-intelligence" tabindex="-1">Enegel.ai Conversational Intelligence <a class="header-anchor" href="#enegel-ai-conversational-intelligence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enegel.ai Conversational Intelligence&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I’m pleased to introduce our first product: Conversational Intelligence.
